# 🌍 Geolocation Analysis of Online Political Discourse in Indonesia

This project investigates the geographic distribution of political sentiment and hate speech in Indonesian online conversations. By leveraging geospatial data and visual analytics, we aim to uncover regional patterns and potential hotspots of polarization across the archipelago.

## 🧾 Project Overview

The rise of social media has reshaped how political opinions are expressed and spread. This project analyzes geocoded social media content to understand how political discourse—both constructive and harmful—varies spatially across Indonesia.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📊 Interactive **geospatial visualizations** of sentiment and hate speech  
- 🧭 Province-level **ranking and clustering** based on discourse intensity  
- 📅 Temporal filtering to observe changes across specific timeframes  
- 🗺️ Easy-to-interpret maps for policymakers, journalists, and researchers  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `Pandas`, `NumPy` – Data manipulation  
- `Geopandas`, `Folium`, `Shapely` – Mapping and spatial operations  
- `Matplotlib`, `Plotly` – Data visualization  
- `GeoJSON`, `JSON` – Geospatial boundary formats  

## 📂 Data Requirements

To run this notebook, you need a dataset containing:
- Latitude and longitude (or admin region)
- Sentiment or hate speech label
- Timestamp of the post
- Optional: platform metadata (e.g., Twitter, YouTube)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize where political discourse is most polarized  
- Identify regions with recurring toxic narratives  
- Provide spatial insights to support digital literacy, moderation, and electoral integrity efforts  

## 📌 Use Cases

- Election watchdogs monitoring regional tension  
- Government agencies crafting region-specific digital campaigns  
- Researchers exploring sociopolitical behavior across diverse geographies
